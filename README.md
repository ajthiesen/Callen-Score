The Callen Score is a project that was inspired by the loss of my son, Callen, at 20(+) weeks gestation.

Pregnancy generally speaking is an exciting and hopeful time. My wife and I were no different. We were excited to be pregnant and were looking forward to the birth of our second child.

At 6 weeks, my wife experienced some bleeding. We were concerned, but the doctor assured us that this was normal. We were told that the bleeding was likely due to a subchorionic hematoma. We were told that this was a common occurrence and that it would likely resolve itself. We were told that there was nothing to worry about. For the most part, this was true.

In the weeks in the interim, we celebrated our pregnancy. My wife planned a new nursery. We explained to our daughter, that she was going to be a big sister. We were excited.

Excitement turned to fear, and eventually sadness and heartbreak.
