# Callen Score Introduction
The _Callen Score_ is a Machine Learning (ML) experiment built on the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Designer.

This experiment has been designed to identify Maternal Risk factors of biologically assigned females at birth, who experience a pregnancy loss, and to attempt to predict the probability of a future pregnancy loss.

The Callen Score is a project that was inspired by the loss of my son, Callen, at 20(+) weeks gestation. The Callen Score is a project that I hope will help other families avoid the heartbreak that my family has experienced.
